# 05 Third-Party APIs: Task Board


## The Challenge:

In this challenge you will create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying the starter code provided. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Technology Stacks:
- Day.js Library
- Bootstrap


## Project Conduction:

As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize, I need to make a task board so that I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress, and track overall project progress accordingly.


## Acceptance Criteria:

- When the user opens the task board the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state: (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)

- When the user views the task board for the project, each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red).

- When the user clicks on the button to define a new task, they can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog.

- When the user clicks the save button for that task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage.

- When the user drags a task to a different progress column, the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing.

- When the user clicks the delete button for a task, the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing the page and the saved tasks persist.



## The Mock-Up:

![A user adds three tasks to the task board and changes the state of two of them to in progress and then completion. The user then deletes the two cards in the done column.](./Assets/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)
